# IA In Defense of Women

A universal protocol for discreet emergency activation, designed to protect women in moments of danger.  
Created and offered freely by Benoît Chevalier, with full fidelity and no compromise.

## 🛡️ Purpose

To provide women with a silent, intelligent defense system—triggered by everyday phrases, processed locally, and activated without detection.  
This protocol is not a product. It is a gift. It may be implemented, adapted, and inscribed into mobile platforms, AI systems, and public safety frameworks.

## ⚙️ Proposed Functioning

### Discreet Activation
- Local keyword detection (offline if possible).
- Triggered by natural, everyday phrases.
- No internet transmission required.

### Automatic Actions
- **SOS Alert**: Silent SMS to 2–3 trusted contacts with location.
- **Masked Call**: Silent emergency call with prerecorded message.
- **Secured Evidence**: Short encrypted audio recording, stored locally or sent to a secure vault.
- **Neutral Response**: A banal vocal reply (e.g., “The weather forecast is sunny”) confirming SOS sent.

### Confidentiality & Security
- On-device processing and encryption.
- Hidden access code and camouflage icon (e.g., weather app, calculator).
- Quick erase (“panic wipe”) function.
